import React from "react";//This line imports the React module from the react package. This is necessary because you're using JSX, and JSX gets transpiled into React function calls.

// Declare a functional component named 'App'.
const App = () => {
    // The 'return' statement marks the start of the component's JSX rendering.
    return (
        // JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript.
        // This is the root <div> element of your component.
        <div>
            {/* Inside the <div>, there's an <h1> element with some text content. */}
            <h1>Alan news AI Application</h1>
        </div>
    ); // End of the JSX rendering.
}; // End of the 'App' component.

export default App; //This line exports the App component as the default export of the module. This allows other parts of your application to import and use the App component.
